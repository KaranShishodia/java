Tic Tac Toe
game build to play.
easy prooject .Tic Tac Toe is a simple and classic two-player game. The game is played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking a space in the grid with their symbol: either an "X" or an "O". The goal is to be the first player to get three of your symbols in a rowâ€”horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
Here are the key points:

It's great for quick, strategic fun! If you'd like, I can guide you in coding a simple Tic Tac Toe game in Java. Let me know if you're up for the challenge.

import java.util.Scanner;

        char player = 'X';
        boolean gameOver = false;
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        while(!gameOver){
            printBoard(board);
            System.out.println("Player"+player="enter:");
            int row = sc.nextInt();
            int col = sc.nextInt();

            if(board[row][col] = ' '){
                board[row][col] = player;
                gameOver = haveWon(board,player);
